    <h1>10 Fascinating facts about the Titanic</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>1. Less than a third of all people aboard the ship survived.</h4>
    <p>Only 705 of the 2,223 passengers and crew members made it back home. Some 61% of the passengers who survived were first-class guests. <br>Less than 25% of third-class passengers survived.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>2. The temperature of the sea water was below freezing when the ship sank.</h4>
    <p>According to measurements taken by Captain Stanley Lord of the SS Californian -- a ship that was near the Titanic when it sank -- water temperatures were as cold as 28 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>The human body can survive up to 45 minutes in freezing water,
      according to the Life Jacket Association.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. The SS Californian was nearby when the Titanic sunk.</h4>
    <p>Controversy exists to this day as to how close the SS Californian was to the Titanic when it struck the iceberg. <br>Californian Captain Stanley Lord testified that his ship was 19 to 21 miles from the stricken ship.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>4. Two young brothers survived the ship without a guardian.</h4>
    <p>Edmond and Michel Navratil went down in history as the only children to survive the Titanic without a parent. They were two years apart in age and were nicknamed the "Titanic Orphans." <br>Their father, Michel Sr., kidnapped them from their mother,
      whom he was no longer with, and planned to take them to America. The last anyone saw of him was when he put his children in a lifeboat. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>5. First-class patrons got to enjoy a heated swimming pool.</h4>
    <p>Passengers who were able to afford first-class tickets enjoyed luxurious treatment and many indulgences. The wealthy got to taste delicacies at Parisian caf√©s, relax in tea gardens, read in the library,
      <br>and play tennis in a squash court just to name a few of the first class perks. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>6. Only 28 people boarded the first lifeboat.</h4>
    <p>but it had the space to carry 65 people. It was one of only 20 lifeboats, though Titanic had the capacity to carry 64.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>7. There were only two bathtubs available for all third-class passengers.</h4>
    <p>There were 706 third-class passengers on the Titanic who paid between between 3 and 8 pounds to make the crossing, and they only had two bathtubs.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>8. New evidence suggests a fire in the ship's hull caused the ship's demise.</h4>
    <p>According to the documentary "Titanic: The New Evidence," a fire aboard the ship prior to its departure may have led to the disaster. <br>Journalist Senan Molony suggests that the metal had weakened because of an ongoing fire in the ship's hull.
      The fire burned at temperatures of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit for three weeks prior to the ship's departure.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>9. The youngest passenger on the Titanic was 2 months old.</h4>
    <p>Millvina Dean was the youngest passenger aboard the ship and the longest living survivor. She died at the age of 97 in 2009.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>10. Six iceberg warnings before collision.</h4>
    <p>Evidently, the most critical iceberg warning never made it to Captain Edward Smith because of the lack of the prefix MSG, meaning Masters' Service Gram. <br>This acronym would have required the captain to personally acknowledge receipt of the message.
      Because it did not have the MSG prefix, the senior radio operator did not think the message was important. </p>
