  <p>RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City. <br>Of the estimated
    2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time. It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship.</p>

  <h3>Secrets about the Titanic</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Titanic was plagued by tragedy from the start. Eight people died during the ship's construction.</li>
    <li>It is rumored that a few men dressed up as women to get a spot on a lifeboat.</li>
    <li>Every single engineer aboard the Titanic perished — they all stayed behind to keep the ship's power running until the very end.</li>
    <li>No city was more affected by the Titanic's sinking than Southampton, England, where the ship had departed from. In one school, half of the students lost their fathers.</li>
    <li>And though it was the biggest ship in the world, it still took 73 years to find its wreckage.</li>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners—<br>the first was the RMS Olympic and
    the third was the HMHS Britannic. Britannic was originally to be called Gigantic and was to be over 1,000 feet (300 m) long. They were by far the largest vessels of the British <br>shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29
    steamers and tenders in 1912. The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, <br>and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent
    corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Dimensions and layout</h3>
  <p>Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m). Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m). <br>She measured 46,328 gross register tons
    and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.</p>

  <h3>Sinking of the Titanic</h3>
  <p>At 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of Titanic and alerted the bridge. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship <br>to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be
    reversed, but it was too late; the starboard side of Titanic struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. <br>The hull was not punctured by the iceberg, but rather dented such that the hull's seams buckled and separated,
    allowing water to rush in. Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. <br>It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. Titanic began sinking bow-first, <br>with
    water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.</p>
