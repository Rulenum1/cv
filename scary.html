    <h1>8 Spooky Facts About The Titanic</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>1. An American Author "Predicted" The Sinking Of The Titanic.</h4>
    <p>In 1898, American author Morgan Robertson wrote The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility, a novella about an enormous ocean liner called the Titan which hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sinks. And like the Titanic,
      <br>the Titan has far too few lifeboats onboard, which leads to mass casualties.</p>
    <p>Later, Robertson would be called a clairvoyant, which he rejected.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>2. A Full Moon May Have Caused The Tragedy.</h4>
    <p>Scientists now believe that a full moon unusually close to Earth may have contributed to the sinking of the great ship. As National Geographic's Richard A. Lovett wrote:
      <br>"That full moon, on January 4, 1912, may have created unusually strong tides that sent a flotilla of icebergs southward — just in time for Titanic's maiden voyage." He added that it was the closest lunar approach since the year 796.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. An Optical Illusion Seems To Have Been At Play As Well.</h4>
    <p>The atmosphere on the night of the sinking may have made it difficult for the crew to spot the iceberg, and for other ships to spot the Titanic. According to Smithsonian magazine:</p>
    <p>Atmospheric conditions in the area that night were ripe for super refraction, Maltin found. This extraordinary bending of light causes miraging, which, he discovered, was recorded by several ships in the area.
      <br>He says it also prevented the Titanic’s lookouts from seeing the iceberg in time and the freighter Californian from identifying the ocean liner and communicating with it.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>4. A Lifeboat Drill Was Scheduled For The Same Day The Ship Sank, But Canceled For Unknown Reasons.</h4>
    <p>The drill could have helped passengers and crew be better-prepared.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>5. Most Of The Victims Died Of Hypothermia.</h4>
    <p>When the ship sank, the temperature in the water was around 28 degrees Fahrenheit, below freezing. Few would have survived more than 15 minutes in such frigid temperatures,
      <br>and approximately one in five would have died within two minutes.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>6. Whiskey might have saved a life.</h4>
    <p>Charles Joughin, the ship's baker, survived in the icy water for two hours before he was rescued. He claimed he didn't feel cold because of all the whiskey he had drunk on the ship.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>7. A Ship Nearby Could Have Saved Them.</h4>
    <p>Just 20 miles away, the SS Californian had stopped to avoid the ice. Its captain saw the Titanic's flares, but ignored them because he thought they were "company rockets."
      <br>The Titanic's SOS signals were not received until the next morning, because the Californian's radio operator had gone to sleep. By the time they got to the scene the next day, all they found were bodies.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>8. The First Newspaper To Report The Sinking Said There Were No Casualties.</h4>
    <p>On Tuesday, April 16, the day after the Titanic sank, the U.K.'s Daily Mail reported that the ship collided with an iceberg, but no lives were lost. It wasn't long before they realized what a terrible mistake they had made.</p>
