    <h4>Why is the Titanic famous?</h4>
    <p>From the outset, the Titanic captured the public’s imagination. At the time, it was one of the largest and most opulent ships in the world. It was also considered unsinkable, <br>due to a series of compartment doors that could be closed if the bow was breached.
      However, four days into its maiden voyage in 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg, <br>and less than three hours later it sank. The drama of the eyewitness accounts and the great loss of life helped make it one of the most well-known tragedies in modern history.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Where is the wreck of the Titanic?</h4>
    <p>The wreck of the Titanic—which was discovered on September 1, 1985—is located at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, some 13,000 feet (4,000 metres) underwater. <br>It is approximately 400 nautical miles (740 km) from Newfoundland, Canada. The ship is in two main pieces,
      the bow and the stern. <br>The exact location of the ship’s bow—which is the largest and most intact portion—is 41°43′57′′ N 49°56′49′′ W.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why did the Titanic sink?</h4>
    <p>The immediate cause of RMS Titanic’s demise was a collision with an iceberg that caused the ocean liner to sink on April 14–15, 1912. <br>While the ship could reportedly stay afloat if as many as 4 of its 16 compartments were breached,
      the impact had affected at least 5 compartments.<br> It was originally believed that the iceberg had caused a long gash in the hull. After examining the wreck, however,<br>
      scientists discovered that the collision had produced a series of thin gashes as well as brittle fracturing and separation of seams in the adjacent hull plates, thus allowing water to flood into the Titanic.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Was The Titanic Sailing Too Fast?</h4>
    <p>At the time of the accident, the Titanic was sailing at 22 knots (25 MPH) which many historians believe was too fast given the knowledge of icebergs in the area.<br>
      It is likely that Captain Edward Smith was worried about arriving late into New York, which is why he chose not to slow down despite warnings.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why Did They Think The Titanic Couldn’t Sink?</h4>
    <p>When the Titanic set sail in 1912, many people thought that she was unsinkable, due in part to the way that her design featured watertight compartments. <br>The ‘unsinkable’ idea was promoted further by newspapers and magazines of the time.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why Didn’t The Titanic Have Enough Life Boats?</h4>
    <p>In 1912 there were no laws stating that a ship had to be equipped with enough lifeboats for every guest.<br>
      Titanic had enough space on the decks to carry enough lifeboats for each guest but the designers of the ship felt as though the lifeboats were unnecessary and were unsightly.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why Did Titanic Not See The Iceberg?</h4>
    <p>The lookouts on the Titanic didn’t see the Iceberg due to still weather conditions and a moonless night. <br>The Titanic had two lookouts who were located in the crows nest, 29 meters about the deck, neither of which had binoculars.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why Did Titanic Not Turn Quickly Enough?</h4>
    <p>After spotting the iceberg, William Murdoch gave the order to stop the engines and to make a hard left turn. Due to the size and speed of the Titanic it was not able to avoid the iceberg.</p>
